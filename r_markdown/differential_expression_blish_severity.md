## Loading the data

For this analysis, we load the Seurat object containing the COVID-19
data from [Wilk et al.Â 2021](https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.20210582) and
the extracted filter response from the disease severity regression
(using the current severity at the time of taking the sample).

``` r
blish <- readRDS("../data/blish_seurat.rds")
filter_response <- read.csv("../output/filter_responses/blish_severity_filter_response.csv",
                            row.names = 1)
```

## Identifying selected cells

For the two filters, we add selected cells, i.e., cells with a filter
response that is larger than
$0.3 \times (\text{maximum filter response})$

``` r
threshold = .3
filter_response$selected_filter_0 <- filter_response$response_filter_0 > threshold *
  max(filter_response$response_filter_0)
cat("Number of selected cells for filter 0:", sum(filter_response$selected_filter_0))
```

    ## Number of selected cells for filter 0: 5070

``` r
filter_response$selected_filter_1 <- filter_response$response_filter_1 > threshold *
  max(filter_response$response_filter_1)
cat("Number of selected cells for filter 1:", sum(filter_response$selected_filter_1))
```

    ## Number of selected cells for filter 1: 4724

``` r
blish <- AddMetaData(blish, filter_response)

DimPlot(blish, cells.highlight = WhichCells(blish, expression = selected_filter_0), reduction = "umap")
```

``` r
coarse_cell_type_selected_0 <- paste(blish@meta.data$cell.type.coarse, blish@meta.data$selected_filter_0)
names(coarse_cell_type_selected_0) <- row.names(blish@meta.data)
blish <- AddMetaData(blish, coarse_cell_type_selected_0, col.name = "coarse_cell_type_selected_0")

coarse_cell_type_selected_1 <- paste(blish@meta.data$cell.type.coarse, blish@meta.data$selected_filter_1)
names(coarse_cell_type_selected_1) <- row.names(blish@meta.data)
blish <- AddMetaData(blish, coarse_cell_type_selected_1, col.name = "coarse_cell_type_selected_1")
```

## Analysing differential expression between selected and unselected cells

For a detailed characterization of selected cells, we determined
differentially expressed genes between selected and unselected cells of
the same type. We did this analysis for the most frequently selected
cell types for the first two filters of the model.

``` r
extract_data_for_violin <- function(adata, genes, cell_type_field, cell_types) {
  selected_cells <- row.names(adata@meta.data[apply(adata[[cell_type_field]], 1, function(x) x %in% cell_types),])
  data <- FetchData(adata, vars = c(genes, cell_type_field), cells = selected_cells, slot = "data")
  return(reshape2::melt(data, id.vars = cell_type_field, variable.name = "gene", value.name = "expression"))
}

make_violin_plot <- function(adata, genes, cell_type_field, cell_types, title, base_size=12, palette="Set2") {
  p <- ggplot(extract_data_for_violin(adata, genes, cell_type_field, cell_types),
              aes(x = gene, y = expression, fill = get(cell_type_field))) +
    geom_split_violin(scale = "width",
                      trim = T) +
    scale_fill_brewer(name = "selected", labels = c("false", "true"), palette = palette) +
    theme_classic(base_size = base_size) +
    theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5),
          axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +
    labs(title=title)
  return(p)
}
```

``` r
cell_types_by_filter <- hash(coarse_cell_type_selected_0 = c("Neutrophil",
                                                             "CD14 mono"),
                             coarse_cell_type_selected_1 = c("DC",
                                                             "CD14 mono"))
for (filt in ls(cell_types_by_filter)) {
  cat("Identifying markers for", filt, "\n")
  Idents(blish) <- filt
  for (ct in cell_types_by_filter[[filt]]) {
    cat("...identifying markers for selected", ct, "cells \n")
    markers <- FindMarkers(blish, ident.1 = paste(ct, "TRUE", sep = " "),
                           ident.2 = paste(ct, "FALSE", sep = " "))
    markers <- markers[markers["p_val_adj"] < 0.05,]
    markers <- cbind(gene = row.names(markers), markers)
    fwrite(markers, file = paste("../output/tables/blish_severity", filt,
                                 gsub(",*\\s|/", "_", ct), "deg.csv",
                                 sep = "_"))
    p <- make_violin_plot(blish,
                          row.names(head(markers[-grep('^MT-', rownames(markers)),], n = 6)),
                          filt, c(paste(ct, "TRUE", sep = " "), paste(ct, "FALSE", sep = " ")),
                          ct, base_size = 14, palette = "Paired")
    print(p)

                 gsub(",*\\s|/", "_", ct), "deg.svg",  sep = "_"), width = 4, height = 4)
    print(p)
    dev.off()
